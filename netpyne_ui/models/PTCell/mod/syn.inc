-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

During the arrival of the presynaptic spike (detected by threshold 
crossing), it is assumed that there is a brief pulse (duration=Cdur)
of neurotransmitter C in the synaptic cleft (the maximal concentration
of C is Cmax).  Then, C is assumed to bind to a receptor Rc according 
to the following first-order kinetic scheme:

Rc + C ---(Alpha)--> Ro							(1)
       <--(Beta)--- 

where Rc and Ro are respectively the closed and open form of the 
postsynaptic receptor, Alpha and Beta are the forward and backward
rate constants.  If R represents the fraction of open gates Ro, 
then one can write the following kinetic equation:

dR/dt = Alpha * C * (1-R) - Beta * R					(2)

and the postsynaptic current is given by:

Isyn = gmax * R * (V-Erev)						(3)

where V is the postsynaptic potential, gmax is the maximal conductance 
of the synapse and Erev is the reversal potential.

If C is assumed to occur as a pulse in the synaptic cleft, such as

C     _____ . . . . . . Cmax
      |   |
 _____|   |______ . . . 0 
     t0   t1

then one can solve the kinetic equation exactly, instead of solving
one differential equation for the state variable and for each synapse, 
which would be greatly time consuming...  

Equation (2) can be solved as follows:

1. during the pulse (from t=t0 to t=t1), C = Cmax, which gives:

   R(t-t0) = Rinf + [ R(t0) - Rinf ] * exp (- (t-t0) / Rtau )		(4)

where 
   Rinf = Alpha * Cmax / (Alpha * Cmax + Beta) 
and
   Rtau = 1 / (Alpha * Cmax + Beta)

2. after the pulse (t>t1), C = 0, and one can write:

   R(t-t1) = R(t1) * exp (- Beta * (t-t1) )				(5)

There is a pointer called "pre" which must be set to the variable which
is supposed to trigger synaptic release.  This variable is usually the
presynaptic voltage but it can be the presynaptic calcium concentration, 
or other.  Prethresh is the value of the threshold at which the release is
initiated.

Once pre has crossed the threshold value given by Prethresh, a pulse
of C is generated for a duration of Cdur, and the synaptic conductances
are calculated accordingly to eqs (4-5).  Another event is not allowed to
occur for Deadtime milliseconds following after pre rises above threshold.

The user specifies the presynaptic location in hoc via the statement
	connect pre_GABA[i] , v.section(x)

where x is the arc length (0 - 1) along the presynaptic section (the currently
specified section), and i is the synapse number (Which is located at the
postsynaptic location in the usual way via
	postsynaptic_section {loc_GABA(i, x)}
Notice that loc_GABA() must be executed first since that function also
allocates space for the synapse.
